## My Thoughts

* I found this article to be extremely relatable and a great personality-filled read! As someone who loved making art from a young age and was considering
it as a career, I really related to the author in the sense that I needed a creative alternative when it came to looking for a job-- I loathed the idea of
being stuck in a job where I had 0 expression and can't create or be in charge of anything. When I found out about Software Engineering as a career and began
to code small projects here and there, I enjoyed the process of coding as it felt a lot like the process of art, which the author of this article also stated. Overall, I really relate to this piece and I hope more artists try out coding!
